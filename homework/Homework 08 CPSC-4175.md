# Homework 8

1. From my perspective, it appears that the best way the authors could think of explaining the Unified Process was through a specific series of steps. However, when reading the chapter, I understand to take this as an example that can be modified for my needs. All one needs to do is extract the necessary elements and arrange them as needed.

2. I do believe this to be a true statment, as I have had some experience with the object-oriented paradigm. It appears to be similar in principle to the spiral approach we have used in class with the same concept and end goal. I personally don't see an differences that aren't superfical. 

3. 
	1. Requirments workflow - is meant to determine the needs of the client as it pertains to the development of the software
	2. Analysis workflow - analyze and refine the requirements to achieve the detailed understanding of the requirements essential for developing a software product
	3. Design workflow - refine the artifacts of the analysis workflow until the material is in a form that can be implemented
	4. Implementation workflow - implemented the target software product in the chosen implementation language 
	5. Test workflow - carried out in parallel to the other workflows to determine if the specifications of the client are being met

4. The software project management plan appears to wrap around the software development process. The SPMP is meant to assign the teams that will take on the different workflows, work out the time schedules for the different work flows, controll where the budget goes, and other management based activities. I don't think it would be practical for the SPMP to replace the software development process as they work in tandem, making sure the individual components are complete.

5. I don't really see any inconsistencies in the book when the testing workflow is being discussed. It appears fairly consistent when discussing the different ways of testing the artifacts when compared to the two rules outlined initally.

6. Well it wouldn't be very difficult, and there are plenty of examples in real life. With the spiral method there is an emphasis on continual improvement. So with each iteration there can be an incremental change that improves the software. These improvements will all follow the same process as the original package.

7. As I have mentioned before, it is apparent to me that these two approaches are built upon the same basic principles with the same end goals in mind on both a macro and micro level. 

8. I think in the real world, there would be an attempt to model this same behavior as closely as possible. Save for any unforseen hiccups, I would assume that this model would hold up.

9. Software improvement is the act of improving the acctual software while the software process improvement is the act of improving the software development process. This is important because the better the process, the better the software that will be produced. This is of great importance to software engineering because the acctual development process is still underdeveloped.

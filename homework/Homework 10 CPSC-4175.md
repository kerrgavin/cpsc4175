1. The first type of planning is the planning that happens once the specifications are complete. For example, this may include determining the types of physical materials that will be required or were the man power will go in each stage. The second type of planning is the planning that happens throughout the project. For example, this may be how an individual piece of code needs to be structured in relation to the rest of the code or what sort of data structures need to be utilized.

2. The figure tells me that the further away from the end of the implementation workflow, the more varied the estimate wil be. At the mid-way point of the requirements workflow, the estimation can be 4 times greater than or less than the actual price. This decreases as one approches the implementation workflow, with a 2 times variation at the analysis workflow and a 1.5 times variation at the design workflow.

3. There is internal cost, which includes salaries and the purchase of hardware, and there is the external cost, which includes the price of the product and other fees that go with it.

	1. Creation of the source code is only a small part of the total software development effort - I have worked on projects before where my team has spent the majority of the time designing the final product and then we were suprised by the small amount of code that was necessary
	2. Implementing the same product in two different languages results in versions with different number of lines of code - I have done this before, where I switched my project over from Java to Python and found that my code was shorter
	3. Not all code implemented is delivered to the client - I have done this for this class project, where I have had to make code which would not be include in the final product but was needed for completion
	4. The number of lines can only be determined after the project is completed - I have been in a situation in which I needed to estimate the number of lines of code a project would take and I could not make an accurate estimate

5. It appears that functional points is system desgined to apply points to a set of different user requirements that are grouped into various categories. Points are given in relation to the complexity. Cost can be extrapolated from the points. This system seems to fix many of the issues associated with LOC, but there are concerns about how relient the system is on the number of lines of code. From what I read, functional point metric is still used widely.

6. Subsection 7 of section 5 goes over the product delivery. When delivering the product, one is required to manage the organizations necessary to complete the delivery, all of the packaging, and all of the documentation necessary for operation and maintinence.

7. This first thing we used was logging. Everytime we do something for the project, we need to note the time and what we added. Also, we have begun trying to make use of self documenting code. 

8. Without the documentation, there is no proof that you put in the effort to make the product. One would need proof of your logical thinking when applied to the product.

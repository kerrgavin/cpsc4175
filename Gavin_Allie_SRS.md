# **Automated Teller Machine**
## Team: Gavin Kerr and Allie McFarland

Expectations:
-Authenticates Customer\n
-Reviews account status\n
-Accepts Deposits\n
-Dispenses Cash\n

*The teller is to be written using the JAVA programming language and may be suplemented using database architecture for authentication. However, compatability may require a purely JAVA based implementation*

## Team: Gavin Kerr and Allie McFarland

Expectations:\n
	\t-Authenticates Customer\n
	\t-Reviews account status\n
	\t-Accepts Deposits\n
	\t-Dispenses Cash\n

*The teller is to be written using the JAVA programming language and may be suplemented using database architecture for authentication. However, compatability may require a purely JAVA based implementation*

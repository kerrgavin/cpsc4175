# **Automated Teller Machine**
## Team: Gavin Kerr and Allie McFarland

Expectations:

- Authenticates Customer
- Reviews account status
- Accepts Deposits
- Dispenses Cash

*The teller is to be written using the JAVA programming language and may be suplemented using database architecture for authentication. However, compatability may require a purely JAVA based implementation*

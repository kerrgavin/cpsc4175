Chapter 2: Digital Logic Design

Logic circuit
	-AND
	-OR
	-NAND
	-XOR
	-NOT
	-Logic circuit design steps:
		*feasibility study
		*circuit design
		*circuit simulation
		*optimization
	-Circuit is then manufactured either on
		* printed circuit board (PCB)
Gates and flip-flops
	-combinational circuit
	
FPGA
	-field-programmable gate array
	-functions like a microprocessor
	-used to implement any logic circuit
	-replace most of the logic circuits designed with standard IC
TPM
	-trusted platform module is a microcontroller that can securely store artifacts used to authenticate the platform
	-artifacts can include passwords, certificates, or encryptioon keys
	-authentication
PUF - Physical unclonable function
	-store digital information on a device that is resistant to physical attack
	-tamper-proof
	-based on a physical system
	-easy to evaluate
	-output looks like a random function
	-unpredictable even an attacker with physical access

TTL
CMOS
Type of IC for 1 bit mem
